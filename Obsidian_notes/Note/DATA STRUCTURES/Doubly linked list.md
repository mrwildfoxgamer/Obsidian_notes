[[DSA]]

*It is a collection of nodes each consists of three parts data part which holds the data one Link pointing to the previous node and another link that points to the next node*

+ In doubly linked list you can move in both direction either from left to right or right to left

| Left Link | Data | Right Link |
| --------- | ---- | ---------- |

Traversal in either direction becomes convenient 

-  Reduces time requirement for the program execution.
- It is used to represent other data structures 
- Trees and graphs can be represented using Doubly linked list
- It takes more memory as now there is 2 links that is to be stored  
- Manipulating the list can be more time consuming as there is now 2 links that is to be taken care of
- Using circular linked list with headers the code base can be  reduced rather than having a huge code base like in Singly linked list
