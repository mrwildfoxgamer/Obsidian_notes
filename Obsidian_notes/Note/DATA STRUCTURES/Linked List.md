### LIST
*A list is a group of data organized sequentially*
eg:`array`

**Array**

- Array uses index for assessing and manipulating array elements
- **Problem with array** - The array size has to be defined at the beginning
- Deleting or Inserting a value require switching elements in the array

**Linked list**

-  Linear data structure
- It is a Ordered collection of finite  same type data elements called nodes and all of them are linked with pointers 
**Node**
- Node is an element in a linked list
- *A node consists of 2 fields Data and Link*
- Data stores actual information and Link points to the next node


| **Array**                                                   | **Linked List**                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Elements are stored in concicutive memeory locations*      | Elements are stored in different memory locations                                       |
| Memory allocated at compile time                            | Memory allocated at runtime                                                             |
| Once memory is allocated it cannot be increased or decresed | Once memory is allocated it can be extended during use-time                             |
| Array is static data structure                              | Linked list is Dynamic data structure                                                   |
| Operations like insertion and deletion takes more time      | Operations like insertions deletion takes less time                                     |
| Memory space is only for stored values                      | Extra memory space for pointers                                                         |
| Accessing the elements is faster                            | Random accessing is not allowed hence each time you have to traverse from the beginning |
