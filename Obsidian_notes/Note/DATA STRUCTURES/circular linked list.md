*A circular linked list is a linked list in which the last element points to the first element of the list a circular linked list consists of two parts the data part that holds the data value and a link that points to the next node*

- In a singly linked list to access any element in the list you have to start from the head but in circular linked list you can start from any element and still be able to reach any other element from the list 
- In a normal linked list it uses `NULL ` to mark the end but if its not handled properly it can cause error while execution since circular linked list does not use `NULL` such problems does not occurs
