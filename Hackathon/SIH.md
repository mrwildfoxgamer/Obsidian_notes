#### Blockchain medical record 

*A decentralized unified patient medical history sharing platform using **blockchain** can solve critical issues like data fragmentation, delayed access, and lack of trust between healthcare providers*

*A decentralized blockchain-based platform that securely unifies and shares patient medical history across hospitals, enabling instant, permissioned access in emergencies while preserving privacy and trust.*

## Description V2


- A Decentralized Patient Medical History Platform for India
- To build a **secure, decentralized platform** that **unifies and shares patient medical histories across hospitals in India**, enabling doctors to access life-saving information during emergencies, while maintaining **patient privacy, control, and legal compliance**.
- a **blockchain-based medical data-sharing system** designed for India’s healthcare ecosystem. The goal is to create a **unified, patient-centric medical record infrastructure** that allows any authorized hospital in the network to **instantly access a patient's medical history** — especially in emergencies — with **patient consent and strong privacy safeguards**.

Instead of storing sensitive data directly on the blockchain, we use **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** to securely store encrypted medical records off-chain, while a **blockchain ledger stores cryptographic hashes, permissions, and access logs** to ensure tamper-proof history and verifiability.

Access is managed via **OAuth2 authentication**, where patients can grant or revoke access to hospitals. In critical situations, **emergency access is granted via a patient-owned token or biometric override**, ensuring care is never delayed. All access is fully **auditable** and traceable by the patient.

The platform is designed with **India-only accessibility**, respecting national data sovereignty and the **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act**.

 - **Decentralized and tamper-proof** record system via blockchain
    
-  **Secure off-chain encrypted storage** using IPFS
    
- **OAuth2-based access control** with patient permission
    
-  **Emergency access mechanism** via token or biometric 
    
- **Access logs & audit trail** for transparency and accountability
    
- **Geo-restricted to India only** for legal compliance
    
-  **Web interface** for patients and hospitals to interact with the system
