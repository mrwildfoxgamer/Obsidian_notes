## Description V2


- A Decentralized Patient Medical History Platform for India
- To build a **secure, decentralized platform** that **unifies and shares patient medical histories across hospitals in India**, enabling doctors to access life-saving information during emergencies, while maintaining **patient privacy, control, and legal compliance**.
- a **blockchain-based medical data-sharing system** designed for India’s healthcare ecosystem. The goal is to create a **unified, patient-centric medical record infrastructure** that allows any authorized hospital in the network to **instantly access a patient's medical history** — especially in emergencies — with **patient consent and strong privacy safeguards**.

Instead of storing sensitive data directly on the blockchain, we use **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** to securely store encrypted medical records off-chain, while a **blockchain ledger stores cryptographic hashes, permissions, and access logs** to ensure tamper-proof history and verifiability.

Access is managed via **OAuth2 authentication**, where patients can grant or revoke access to hospitals. In critical situations, **emergency access is granted via a patient-owned token or biometric override**, ensuring care is never delayed. All access is fully **auditable** and traceable by the patient.

The platform is designed with **India-only accessibility**, respecting national data sovereignty and the **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act**.

 - **Decentralized and tamper-proof** record system via blockchain
    
-  **Secure off-chain encrypted storage** using IPFS
    
- **OAuth2-based access control** with patient permission
    
-  **Emergency access mechanism** via token or biometric 
    
- **Access logs & audit trail** for transparency and accountability
    
- **Geo-restricted to India only** for legal compliance
    
-  **Web interface** for patients and hospitals to interact with the system

- India's health infrastructure is seriously challenged in the sharing of patient medical histories between hospitals, resulting in delays and mistakes during emergency situations. Files are usually fragmented, unavailable, or written, undermining patient care and safety. Given growing demand for digital health technology solutions and greater emphasis on data protection under the DPDP Act, a fast-growing need exists for a secure, interoperable, and patient-controlled framework. A decentralized blockchain platform guarantees tamper-proof access, real-time availability, and compliance—filling gaps in continuity of care and empowering the patient within a fast-digitizing healthcare environment.
- The solution is a decentralized, blockchain-based platform built with Polygon or Hyperledger, IPFS for encrypted off-chain storage, and OAuth2 for secure access control. It unifies patient medical histories across Indian hospitals, allowing patients to manage access and permissions. Emergency access is enabled via biometric or token-based overrides. Smart contracts ensure tamper-proof logging, while React, Node.js/FastAPI, and Solidity power the web interface and backend. The system is fully auditable and compliant with India’s DPDP Act, ensuring real-time, privacy-preserving, and transparent access to critical health data across the healthcare network.
- This is a one-of-a-kind platform that uses blockchain, IPFS, and OAuth2 to build a completely decentralized, patient-owned medical record system that is specific to India. It differs from centralized systems because it provides tamper-proof logging, securestorage off-chain, and real-time, consent-based access to all hospitals. Emergency overrides through biometric/token accessprevent delays in care. Geo-restriction and adherence to the DPDP Act make it legally practicable. Its cloud-free, open-source design renders it scalable and cost-effective for Indian healthcare infrastructure, giving patients transparency, control, and privacy—unparalleled by any other solution.
- Unlike traditional centralized health record systems or cloud-based EHR platforms, our solution is fully decentralized. using blockchain for tamper-proof access logs and IPFS for secure, encrypted off-chain storage. Patients have complete control over who accesses their data via OAuth2-based permissions with an emergency override system for critical cases. Competitor systems often lack interoperability, real-time consent management and patient transparency Additionally, our platform is designed to run without cloud dependency, ensuring cost efficiency and compliance with India’s DPDP Act through geo-restriction features rarely offered together in existing market solutions.


## Hash it up


1. **Problem statement**
In India, patient medical histories are scattered across hospitals, often stored on paper or isolated systems, making them inaccessible during emergencies. This causes critical delays, repeated tests, and medical errors because doctors don’t have instant access to past treatments, allergies, or conditions. Patients lack control over their own data, while hospitals struggle with trust, interoperability
2. **Solution statement**
Our platform unifies patient medical histories using blockchain for tamper-proof access, IPFS for secure storage, and OAuth2 for patient-controlled permissions, enabling doctors to instantly access life-saving records in emergencies while ensuring privacy and compliance.
3. **Detailed Statement** 
India’s healthcare system struggles with fragmented and inaccessible patient records, often leading to delays and errors during emergencies. Medical histories are scattered across hospitals or kept in paper form, making it difficult for doctors to access critical information when it matters most. With the introduction of the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, there is an urgent need for a secure, interoperable, and patient-controlled solution.
Our platform is a decentralized medical history sharing system built on blockchain and IPFS. Blockchain ensures tamper-proof access logs, while IPFS securely stores encrypted records off-chain. Patients manage permissions through OAuth2, granting or revoking access in real time. In emergencies, records can be instantly unlocked using a biometric or token-based override, ensuring care is never delayed.
The system is geo-restricted to India for legal compliance, and all access is fully auditable by patients for transparency and trust. Built with Polygon/Hyperledger, Solidity, IPFS, Node.js/FastAPI, and React, the solution is scalable, cloud-free, and cost-effective.
By unifying records across hospitals, this platform saves lives in emergencies, empowers patients with control, and ensures privacy while aligning with India’s DPDP Act.

AI driven train induction planning and scheduling for KMRL. 
Good morning, Namah shivaya we are team byteforce lets meet our team members 
Alan johny- team lead
Myself rose raj
Gopika sunil
Yafis yasar a
Kishor nair
Sherin k sebastian
We are here to talk about unified centralized live dashboard for KMRL.  As there is a major problem that is affecting kochi metro. 
Every night, Supervisors  must decide which `if its` 25 trains-sets 
Run in service the next morning 
Stay on standby or
Go for maintenance 
These decisions depend on six factors 
	1.	fitness certificates
	2.	Job card status : where the train is down for maintenance or good to go. 
	3.	Branding properties: it means train carry paid advertising wraps that must be seen for a promised number of service hours.  KM would fail to meet contract obligations and financial penalties. 

Currently, these are tracked in separate spreadsheet, logbooks,WhatsApp updates and supervisors make decisions manually in just 2 hours. 
So the issue with current method 
	1.	Risk of mistakes as when supervisors picks a train to service for the day and when its missing telecom clearance or fitness certificates , the team might get out of the service and it may affect the whole schedule of the day. 
	2.	Uneven mileage:It can cause faster wear and higher maintenance cost. 

So we came up with a solution that is Unified centralized live dashboard for KMRL that simplifies the decision making of the supervisor by collecting all the data and making it accessible in a single unified platform. 

So the method is 
	1.	On phase 1, (setup + data visualization )we’ll set up the core system by creating a React frontend with an Express backend, enabling CSV upload and parsing for job cards, mileage, branding, and depot data. This data will feed into a basic train list table UI that displays all trainsets in a clear, structured view. we’ll focus on strengthening the dashboard by adding colour-coded validation rules, integrating OCR with Tesseract.js to read fitness certificates, and implementing a mileage balancer that flags overused or underused trains. we’ll complete the system by adding a train selection and scheduling modal using FullCalendar.js, displaying alerts clearly at the top, polishing the UI with Tailwind preparing a smooth demo. 
	2.	on Phase 2,  we scale the Project we will improve the database management by replacing SQLight with prostgresSQL for more improved reliability and performance integrating a machine learning service helps improve predictions, and finally a decision service combines everything and gives a ranked list of which trains should run, which can be accessed through a simple API (REST).
